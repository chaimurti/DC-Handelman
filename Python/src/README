Th file polynomial.py contains an implementation for symbolic computation of multi variable polynomials which are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation.
The file im.py generates the coefficients of the polynomial for the shape for shading problem.
Run the file as 

```
$ python im.py <path to image>.png
```
The image is expected to be greyscale. After running the above command, a folder with files {i}_{j}.txt will be generated.
Each file contains the coefficients for each f_r which is in binary order of exponents.

These coefficients are calculated according to Equation (12) in [1].

Requirements:

python==3.10.0
Pillow==10.0.0
numpy==1.25.2
tqdm==4.66.1
